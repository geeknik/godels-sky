# Gödel's Sky Quarg Consequence Missions
# The Quarg are an ancient, powerful, and enigmatic species. They are patient
# and forbearing, but act decisively when necessary. They have observed the
# galaxy for millions of years and have a perspective that younger species
# cannot comprehend. Consequences reflect their patience, their power, and
# their deep concern for galactic stability.
