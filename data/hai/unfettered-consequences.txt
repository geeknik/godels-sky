# Gödel's Sky Unfettered Hai Extended Consequence Missions
# The Unfettered Hai are a militant faction who reject the "taming" of their species.
# They respect strength, directness, and action over words.
# Unlike the peaceful Hai, they value warriors and respond to violence differently.
# They see themselves as the "True Hai" - what the Hai were before Drak intervention.
