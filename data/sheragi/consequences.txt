# Gödel's Sky Sheragi Consequence Missions
# The Sheragi are an extinct dragon-like species who destroyed themselves in civil war.
# Their ruins are being excavated, and their legacy serves as a warning.
# These consequences deal with archaeology, memory, and the lessons of extinction.
# The Archons guard their memory as an example to other species.

He wrote about how each victory made the next war seem more necessary. He called it 'the escalation trap.' By the end, he was commanding weapons that could sterilize entire planets."`

			`	"They failed, of course. The war consumed them too. But their writings survive. They spoke of the burden of protection - how difficult it is to defend without becoming a destroyer yourself. They warned about the 'guardian's trap': the temptation to prevent harm by causing greater harm."`
			`	"You protect people, Captain. That's rare and valuable. Just remember: the Sheragi protectors lost their way when they started deciding who deserved protection and who didn't.

			`	"Of course, eventually even they got pulled into the conflict. Both sides accused them of supporting the other. But for a while, they were the only thing keeping Sheragi society from completely collapsing." He pauses. "Sometimes I think merchants are underappreciated.
